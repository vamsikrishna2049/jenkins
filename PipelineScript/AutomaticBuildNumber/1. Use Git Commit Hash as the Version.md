You can use the latest Git commit hash (or a short version of it) to uniquely tag the Docker image, ensuring that each build has a distinct version number based on the commit.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        IMAGE = 'your-image-name'
        VERSION = "${GIT_COMMIT.take(7)}" // First 7 characters of the commit hash
    }

    stages {
        stage("Git Checkout") {
            steps {
                git url: 'https://your-repo-url.git', branch: 'main'
                echo "Git Repo Clone Completed"
            }
        }
        stage("Docker Image Build") {
            steps {
                script {
                    docker.build("${IMAGE}:${VERSION}")
                    docker.push("${IMAGE}:${VERSION}")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**In this example:**
- GIT_COMMIT is a predefined environment variable in Jenkins that contains the full commit hash of the checked-out commit.
- GIT_COMMIT.take(7) grabs the first 7 characters of the commit hash to use as the version number.
