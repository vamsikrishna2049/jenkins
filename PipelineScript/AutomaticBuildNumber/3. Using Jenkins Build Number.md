### 3. **Using Jenkins Build Number**
Jenkins also has a built-in `BUILD_NUMBER` variable that you can use to tag the Docker image. This will give each Docker image a unique version number based on the Jenkins build count.

Example:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        IMAGE = 'your-image-name'
        VERSION = "${BUILD_NUMBER}" // Using Jenkins build number as the version
    }

    stages {
        stage("Git Checkout") {
            steps {
                git url: 'https://your-repo-url.git', branch: 'main'
                echo "Git Repo Clone Completed"
            }
        }
        stage("Docker Image Build") {
            steps {
                script {
                    docker.build("${IMAGE}:${VERSION}")
                    docker.push("${IMAGE}:${VERSION}")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this case:
- `BUILD_NUMBER` is automatically incremented with each build triggered in Jenkins. This ensures a unique version for every build.

### Choosing a Versioning Strategy:
- **Git Commit Hash:** Good for tracking exactly which code corresponds to each Docker image, especially useful in continuous delivery pipelines.
- **Incremental Versioning (File-based or Jenkins Build Number):** Ideal if you need a more traditional versioning scheme that follows a predictable increment for each build.
