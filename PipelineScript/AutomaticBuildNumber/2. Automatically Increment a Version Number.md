### 2. **Automatically Increment a Version Number**
Another approach is to keep track of the last version number and increment it with each build. You could store this version number in a file or use a counter stored in Jenkins.

#### Storing Version Number in a File
You can store the version number in a file (e.g., `version.txt`), and each time a new build is triggered, increment the version number in the file.

Here’s an example:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        IMAGE = 'your-image-name'         // The name of your Docker image
        VERSION_FILE = 'version.txt'      // The file to store the version number
    }

    stages {
        stage("Git Checkout") {
            steps {
                git url: 'https://your-repo-url.git', branch: 'main'
                echo "Git Repo Clone Completed"
            }
        }
        
        stage("Get Version Number") {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Check if the version file exists
                    if (fileExists(VERSION_FILE)) {
                        // Read the current version number
                        def version = readFile(VERSION_FILE).trim()
                        // Increment the version number
                        def newVersion = version.toInteger() + 1
                        // Write the new version back to the file
                        writeFile(file: VERSION_FILE, text: newVersion.toString())
                        // Set the new version to the environment variable
                        env.VERSION = newVersion.toString()
                        echo "New Version: ${env.VERSION}"
                    } else {
                        // Initialize the version number if the file doesn't exist
                        def newVersion = 1
                        writeFile(file: VERSION_FILE, text: newVersion.toString())
                        env.VERSION = newVersion.toString()
                        echo "Initialized Version: ${env.VERSION}"
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        stage("Docker Image Build") {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Build the Docker image with the new version
                    docker.build("${IMAGE}:${VERSION}")
                    // Optionally, push the image to a registry (e.g., DockerHub)
                    docker.push("${IMAGE}:${VERSION}")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The pipeline first reads the current version number from the `version.txt` file.
- It increments the version by 1 and writes the updated version number back to `version.txt`.
- The new version is then used to tag the Docker image.

**Explanation of Each Stage:**
**Git Checkout Stage:**
This stage pulls the code from the specified Git repository and branch. This is where your source code for the Docker build will come from.

**Get Version Number Stage:**
This stage checks if the version.txt file exists.
If it exists, it reads the current version, increments it by 1, and writes the updated version back to the file.
If it does not exist (i.e., it's the first build), it initializes the version number to 1, writes it to the file, and uses it as the version for the Docker image.

**Docker Image Build Stage:**
This stage uses the incremented version number stored in the VERSION environment variable to tag the Docker image.
It then pushes the tagged Docker image to the Docker registry (e.g., DockerHub).

**Additional Considerations:**
**Handling Version Conflicts:** If multiple Jenkins jobs are running concurrently, there’s a potential for conflicts in the version file (e.g., two jobs reading the version at the same time and both writing the same new version). To avoid this, you can add locking mechanisms (e.g., lock() in Jenkins Pipeline) or manage versions in a centralized system like a database or versioning service.
**Version Initialization:** The version is initialized to 1 if the version.txt file does not exist. This can be adjusted to any starting version number you prefer.
**Custom Versioning Scheme:** If you'd like to use a more complex versioning scheme (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2, etc.), you can implement logic to handle semantic versioning (major, minor, patch) and update parts of the version number based on build triggers (e.g., a bug fix might only increment the patch number, etc.).

---

Great! Let's dive deeper into managing versions across **multiple builds in parallel** to prevent version conflicts when multiple Jenkins jobs are running simultaneously.

When dealing with multiple concurrent builds, the challenge is that two or more builds might try to read, update, and write the version number from the same `version.txt` file at the same time. This could result in race conditions where two builds end up with the same version number.

### Approaches to Prevent Version Conflicts

1. **Using a Locking Mechanism (Recommended):**
   You can use Jenkins' built-in `lock` step to ensure that only one build can access the version file at a time. This step prevents concurrent access to shared resources like the `version.txt` file, ensuring that only one build at a time reads and writes to the version file.

   Here's how to apply this to your pipeline:

### Updated Pipeline with Locking Mechanism:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        IMAGE = 'your-image-name'       // Docker image name
        VERSION_FILE = 'version.txt'    // The file to store the version number
    }

    stages {
        stage("Git Checkout") {
            steps {
                git url: 'https://your-repo-url.git', branch: 'main'
                echo "Git Repo Clone Completed"
            }
        }

        stage("Get Version Number") {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Use a lock to prevent multiple builds from accessing version.txt at the same time
                    lock(resource: 'version-lock') {
                        // Check if the version file exists
                        if (fileExists(VERSION_FILE)) {
                            // Read the current version number
                            def version = readFile(VERSION_FILE).trim()
                            // Increment the version number
                            def newVersion = version.toInteger() + 1
                            // Write the new version back to the file
                            writeFile(file: VERSION_FILE, text: newVersion.toString())
                            // Set the new version to the environment variable
                            env.VERSION = newVersion.toString()
                            echo "New Version: ${env.VERSION}"
                        } else {
                            // Initialize the version number if the file doesn't exist
                            def newVersion = 1
                            writeFile(file: VERSION_FILE, text: newVersion.toString())
                            env.VERSION = newVersion.toString()
                            echo "Initialized Version: ${env.VERSION}"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        stage("Docker Image Build") {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Build the Docker image with the new version
                    docker.build("${IMAGE}:${VERSION}")
                    // Optionally, push the image to a registry (e.g., DockerHub)
                    docker.push("${IMAGE}:${VERSION}")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Points:
- **Locking Mechanism (`lock()`):**
  - The `lock()` step ensures that only one Jenkins build can access the `version.txt` file at a time. If another build tries to access the file while the lock is held, it will wait until the lock is released.
  - The `resource: 'version-lock'` argument is used to define the resource being locked. All builds that use the same resource name (`'version-lock'`) will share the same lock, ensuring that no two builds update the version number simultaneously.

### Why This Works:
- **Concurrency Control:** The lock guarantees that even if multiple Jenkins builds are triggered simultaneously, only one build will read and update the version number at any given time. This prevents race conditions, where two builds might get assigned the same version number.
- **Ensuring Version Uniqueness:** The version number is incremented safely, even if there are multiple builds happening at the same time, ensuring that each build gets a unique version number.

### 2. **Using a Centralized Versioning System (Alternative Approach)**

If you prefer not to use the file-based approach or if you want more sophisticated version control, you could consider using a **centralized versioning system**. This could be a database or even an API that tracks the version number for you. With this approach, the versioning system can handle concurrent access, and your pipeline would simply query it to get the latest version number.

For example, you could use a cloud-based service like **AWS DynamoDB**, **Google Firestore**, or any other key-value store, or even a simple API service that returns the current version and automatically increments it when requested.

Here's a conceptual overview of how this might look in your pipeline (assuming a simple REST API for version management):

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        IMAGE = 'your-image-name'     // Docker image name
        VERSION_API_URL = 'https://your-api.com/get-next-version' // API that returns the next version
    }

    stages {
        stage("Git Checkout") {
            steps {
                git url: 'https://your-repo-url.git', branch: 'main'
                echo "Git Repo Clone Completed"
            }
        }

        stage("Get Version Number") {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Query the API to get the next available version number
                    def response = httpRequest(url: VERSION_API_URL)
                    def newVersion = response.data.toInteger()
                    env.VERSION = newVersion.toString()
                    echo "New Version: ${env.VERSION}"
                }
            }
        }

        stage("Docker Image Build") {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Build the Docker image with the new version
                    docker.build("${IMAGE}:${VERSION}")
                    // Optionally, push the image to a registry (e.g., DockerHub)
                    docker.push("${IMAGE}:${VERSION}")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Benefits of a Centralized Versioning System:
- **Scalability:** Works well in large organizations where multiple systems are consuming and managing versions.
- **Concurrency Handling:** A good API or database solution will handle concurrent version requests safely without needing to manage locks in your pipeline.
- **Flexibility:** You can implement custom logic (e.g., semantic versioning) and integrate with other systems, like deployment tools or release managers.

---

### Choosing the Best Approach:
- **Locking Mechanism:** Ideal for smaller projects or when you want to keep things simple and maintain versioning locally. It's easy to implement and works well with Jenkins' built-in features.
- **Centralized Versioning System:** Best for larger projects with distributed systems or if you want to decouple version management from Jenkins. This approach provides more flexibility and scalability but requires an external system (like an API or database).
