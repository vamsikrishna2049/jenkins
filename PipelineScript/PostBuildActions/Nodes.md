# Understanding Post Build Actions in Jenkins
Jenkins is a powerful tool used by developers to automate various stages of the software development lifecycle. It helps automate tasks like building, testing, and deploying applications. When you configure a Jenkins job, you usually define a set of actions that Jenkins should perform. These actions can be set to run **before** or **after** the build process. While the **Build** phase is the most critical, **Post Build Actions** are just as important, as they enable you to manage the results of a build.

## What are Post Build Actions?
Post Build Actions are the tasks that Jenkins performs **after** the main build process is finished. These actions can be configured to run regardless of whether the build was successful or if it failed. Essentially, they allow Jenkins to carry out additional tasks based on the results of the build.
While Jenkins can automate the building and testing of your application, **Post Build Actions** extend the automation further by handling actions like notifications, archiving important files, and triggering other processes once the build is done.

### Why Are Post Build Actions Important?
Post Build Actions are crucial for several reasons:

1. **Automation**: They help automate repetitive tasks that must be done after a build, saving time and effort.
2. **Notifications**: Sending email or Slack notifications to team members about the success or failure of the build can help with faster issue resolution.
3. **Archiving**: Storing important build files, logs, and reports is important for tracking, debugging, or deploying the project in the future.
4. **Integration**: Post Build Actions allow you to chain jobs together. For example, after one build finishes, another job can be automatically triggered.
5. **Collaboration**: Notifying stakeholders or team members when a build succeeds or fails keeps everyone in the loop, improving communication and transparency.

## Common Post Build Actions
Jenkins offers a variety of post-build actions, each designed to handle different tasks. Some of the most commonly used ones include:

### 1. **Email Notification**
One of the most useful post-build actions is **Email Notification**. This action sends an email to a designated recipient, letting them know the status of the build (whether it was successful, unstable, or failed). This is especially useful for teams to stay informed about the build process.

#### How to configure Email Notification:
- In the Post-build Actions section of your Jenkins job configuration, select **"Editable Email Notification"**.
- Fill in the recipient email addresses, subject, and content. You can use **Jenkins variables** (e.g., `$BUILD_STATUS`, `$BUILD_URL`) to customize the message.
- You can specify triggers to send emails when the build is either successful or fails.

### 2. **Archiving Build Artifacts**
After the build is completed, you might want to save the **build artifacts** (e.g., compiled files, logs, test reports). Jenkins allows you to archive the build artifacts so they can be stored and retrieved later. This is especially useful when you want to keep track of outputs from every build.

#### How to configure Artifact Archiving:
- In the Post-build Actions section, select **"Archive the artifacts"**.
- Specify the files or directories to archive, using **wildcards** like `*.jar` or `**/*.html` to match all files of a certain type.
- You can choose whether to keep the artifacts from the latest build or all past builds, depending on your needs.

### 3. **Triggering Another Job**
Another useful feature of Jenkins is the ability to **trigger another job** automatically after the current job finishes. For example, you may want to run a test job after the main build is done or deploy your application after successful tests.

#### How to configure Job Triggering:
- Select **"Build other projects"** under the Post-build Actions section.
- Specify the name of the job you want to trigger.
- You can configure it to trigger based on the build status, such as only running the next job if the current build was successful.

### 4. **Slack Notifications**
Many development teams use **Slack** to communicate, and Jenkins can send build notifications directly to a Slack channel. This helps keep the team updated without needing to check email constantly.

#### How to configure Slack Notifications:
- You will need to install the **Slack Notification Plugin** in Jenkins.
- Once installed, go to the **Post-build Actions** section and select **"Slack Notifications"**.
- You will need to configure the Slack channel and authentication settings. After that, Slack will receive messages whenever a build is completed, giving your team real-time updates on the build status.

### 5. **Build Stability**
Jenkins also provides the ability to **track build stability** over time. If you have multiple builds, you can keep an eye on how often your builds pass or fail. You can configure Jenkins to send stability reports or trigger actions based on long-term trends.

#### How to track Build Stability:
- You can use plugins like **Build Failure Analyzer** to analyze the causes of failed builds.
- Configure Jenkins to track the trends and generate stability reports that help in identifying recurring issues.

### 6. **Deploying the Build**
Once your project has been built and tested, you may want to deploy it automatically to a staging or production environment. Jenkins allows you to configure **deployment steps** after the build is complete, ensuring that your code moves to the next environment seamlessly.

#### How to deploy the build:
- You can use a post-build action like **"Deploy to container"** or custom scripts to deploy the build to a server.
- Many deployment tools and cloud platforms (such as AWS, Docker, or Kubernetes) have Jenkins plugins that allow you to deploy your app automatically after a build completes successfully.

## How to Configure Post Build Actions in Jenkins

Let’s walk through how to configure Post Build Actions in Jenkins:

### Step 1: Open Your Jenkins Job
- Navigate to the Jenkins dashboard and open the job you want to configure.

### Step 2: Edit Job Configuration
- Click on **"Configure"** from the left sidebar to open the job configuration page.

### Step 3: Scroll to the "Post-build Actions" Section
- Scroll down the page until you reach the **Post-build Actions** section. 

### Step 4: Add and Configure Post Build Actions
- Click on **"Add post-build action"** to see a dropdown list of available actions (e.g., Email Notification, Archive Artifacts, etc.).
- Choose the appropriate post-build action you want to configure.
- Fill in the necessary details based on the action you selected (e.g., email addresses, artifact patterns, other job names).

### Step 5: Save the Configuration
- After configuring the post-build actions, click **"Save"** to save the changes to your Jenkins job.

## Best Practices for Post Build Actions

1. **Keep It Simple**: Avoid cluttering your Jenkins job with too many post-build actions. Keep the list relevant and focused on actions that help with monitoring or deploying the build.
2. **Use Conditional Triggers**: For actions like notifications or deployments, consider triggering them based on build status (e.g., only send a failure email if the build fails).
3. **Monitor Over Time**: Track build trends over time to catch recurring issues early.


# Summary
### How to write Post Build Actions:
1. **Go to the Jenkins job**: First, open the Jenkins dashboard and select the job you want to work with.
2. **Configure the job**: Click on the “Configure” option of the job.
3. **Scroll to the Post-build Actions section**: Once you're in the job configuration page, scroll down to find the **Post-build Actions** section.
4. **Add a Post Build Action**: Click on the **"Add post-build action"** dropdown and select what you want to do (e.g., "Email Notification", "Archive the artifacts", etc.).
5. **Configure the chosen action**: Depending on what you choose, you'll have fields to fill out. For example, if you select "Email Notification", you need to set who should receive the emails and when.
6. **Save the job**: After you've added and configured your post-build actions, make sure to click the **Save** button.

### Example Scenario:
Imagine you have a project that builds a website. You want to:
1. **Run the build** to create the website.
2. **Send an email** to your team to tell them if the build was successful or not.
3. **Save the files** (like HTML and images) for future use or deployment.

### Example of Post Build Actions:
- **Send email notifications**: You might want to tell someone if the build passed or failed.
- **Archiving build artifacts**: Save files that were created during the build, like reports or packages.
- **Deploy the project**: Move the build to a different environment, like a test server.
- **Trigger another job**: Start another Jenkins job automatically after the current one finishes.
