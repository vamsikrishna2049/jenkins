This script provides a simple structure for a CI pipeline that builds a Maven project, handles environment variables, prints logs, and archives artifacts after a successful build.

### 1. **Pipeline Definition**
```groovy
pipeline {
```
This is the top-level block that defines the Jenkins pipeline. It encapsulates the entire build process.

### 2. **Agent**
```groovy
    agent {
        label 'DevServer'
    }
```
- **Agent** specifies where the pipeline will run. In this case, it will execute on a Jenkins node labeled `DevServer`. 
- The `label` indicates the agent or node in your Jenkins setup that has this specific label assigned. Jenkins will choose an appropriate node that matches the label for running the pipeline.

### 3. **Environment**
```groovy
    environment {
        NAME = "vamsi"
    }
```
- The `environment` block defines environment variables that are available throughout the pipeline.
- The variable `NAME` is set to the string "vamsi". This variable can be accessed anywhere in the pipeline using `$NAME`.

### 4. **Tools**
```groovy
    tools {
        maven 'maven-3.9.7'
    }
```
- The `tools` block specifies the tools that the pipeline will use. In this case, it is specifying that the pipeline should use **Maven** version `maven-3.9.7` to build the project.
- This version of Maven must be configured in Jenkins' global tool configuration.

### 5. **Stages**
```groovy
    stages {
```
This section defines the stages of the pipeline. Each stage is a distinct phase in the build process.

#### 5.1 **Build Stage**
```groovy
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean package'
                sh "echo started by $NAME ${params.LastName}"
            }
```
- The **Build** stage is responsible for compiling the project using Maven.
    - The first command `sh 'mvn clean package'` runs Maven with the `clean` and `package` goals:
      - `clean` deletes any previously compiled files to ensure a fresh build.
      - `package` compiles the source code, runs tests, and packages the project (e.g., into a JAR or WAR file).
    - The second command `sh "echo started by $NAME ${params.LastName}"` prints a message to the console log. It uses:
        - The `NAME` environment variable, which is set to "vamsi".
        - A **parameter** `LastName`, which is expected to be passed to the pipeline. The `${params.LastName}` is used to reference the value of this parameter.

#### 5.2 **Post-Actions**
```groovy
            post {
                success {
                    archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'target/*.war', allowEmptyArchive: true
                }
            }
```
- The `post` block defines actions that will be executed after the stage finishes, regardless of success or failure. Here, it's defined for a `success` condition:
  - **`archiveArtifacts`**: This action archives any WAR files located in the `target/` directory. This is a common directory where Maven stores the compiled artifacts, like JAR or WAR files.
    - `artifacts: 'target/*.war'`: This specifies that any `.war` files in the `target` directory should be archived.
    - `allowEmptyArchive: true`: This allows the pipeline to proceed even if no WAR files are found (e.g., if the build failed and no artifact was generated).

### 6. **End of Pipeline**
```groovy
    }
}
```
- The closing braces `}` mark the end of the pipeline definition.

---

### **Summary of Pipeline Behavior:**
1. **Agent**: The pipeline runs on the node labeled `DevServer`.
2. **Environment Variable**: The variable `NAME` is set to "vamsi" and can be used throughout the pipeline.
3. **Tool Setup**: The pipeline ensures that Maven version `maven-3.9.7` is available for the build.
4. **Build Stage**: 
    - The `mvn clean package` command builds the project.
    - A message is printed with the `NAME` and the `LastName` parameter (which is expected to be provided to the pipeline).
5. **Post Actions**: If the build is successful, the resulting WAR files in the `target/` directory are archived.
